== Purpose

CloudFormation templates are a great way to automate AWS provisioning and updates. The AWS architecture team provides
and updates many https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/[sample templates^] but release
versioning is left to the consumer. Teams within organizations will commonly incorporate some of the AWS example
material into local solutions which are then revised further over time introducing breaking changes.

As the templates are just source code so one approach would be to use git submodules, but those aren't everyone's cup of
tea. The cfn-stacks approach is to publish versioned packages which can be referenced from other Cloudformation
templates directly or pulled locally using a dependency management tool. Rather than inventing a new toolchain the
reference implementation uses Java tooling as it's well known but the concept could be implemented in many different
ways.

== Overview

A repository is used to store artifacts and a Gradle plugin to automate publishing. The plugin embeds version
information into the output section of the template for identification post deployment and then packages the templates
into a Java Archive or .jar file with and additional identifying suffix .cfn.jar. A publish task is provided to create
the Maven repo artifact metadata and to automate the push to the repository.

The repository is an S3 bucket with an attached Lambda function that will unpack CloudFormation jars (*.cfn.jar) using
key prefixes that preserve the organization and version information. The CloudFormation service requires that template
files be hosted from S3 and by publishing to the repo we make versioned artifacts available for inclusion into other
templates.

=== Data Flows

. *Publish templates via GitHub push:* Developers -> GitHub -> Travis CI -> Gradle plugin in project -> ArtifactS3 Repo
    in S3. Template projects would include a .travis.yml file that would call the publish task.
    * Example: `git commit -m"Updated template"; git push`
. *Publish templates directly:* Developers -> Gradle plugin in project -> ArtifactS3 Repo in S3
    * Example: `./gradlew publish`
. *ArtifactS3 repo process:* New artifact -> Unzipped by Lambda function -> Artifact is now available as a Maven
    dependency or a Cloudformation template hosted in S3
    * Example `./gradlew createStack` using a template that includes another published
        template as a
        http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html[Nested Stack].

== Build/Deploy

=== Prerequisite

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 8 JDK^]: Download from Oracle or
    use a packaged version for your OS

=== Command

`./gradlew build` will create the ArtifactS3 repo CloudFormation template in `build/cloudformation/artifats3-repo.yaml`

=== Deployment

There are several prerequisite steps that have to be accomplished manually before CloudFormation can automatically
deploy and then later update a stack. All of the steps below are one-time tasks that once created and configured within
the project shouldn't need to be updated.

. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html[Install the AWS CLI^] and configure a
    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html[named profile^]
. We'll go over all the options later in the docs but at a minimum a private repo can be created using just a
    single command with a few parameters `./gradlew -Pprofile=YOUR_PROFILE_NAME -Pstack=STACK_NAME -PDomainName=UNIQUE_S3_BUCKET_NAME`

=== Updates

. Updates to the stack are accomplished by running the `./gradlew updateStack` commmand again and changing either a command
    line parameter or one of the config files.
