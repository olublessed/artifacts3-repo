== Purpose

CloudFormation templates are a great way to automate AWS provisioning and updates. The AWS architecture team provides
and updates many https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/[sample templates^] but release
versioning is left to the consumer. Teams within organizations will commonly incorporate some of the AWS example
material into local solutions which are then revised further over time introducing breaking changes.

As the templates are just source code so one approach would be to use git submodules, but those aren't everyone's cup of
tea. The cfn-stacks approach is to publish versioned packages which can be referenced from other Cloudformation
templates directly or pulled locally using a dependency management tool. Rather than inventing a new toolchain the
reference implementation uses Java tooling as it's well known but the concept could be implemented in many different
ways.

== Overview

A repository is used to store artifacts and a Gradle plugin to automate publishing. The plugin embeds version
information into the output section of the template for identification post deployment and then packages the templates
into a Java Archive or .jar file with and additional identifying suffix .cfn.jar. A publish task is provided to create
the Maven repo artifact metadata and to automate the push to the repository.

The repository is an S3 bucket with an attached Lambda function that will unpack CloudFormation jars (*.cfn.jar) using
key prefixes that preserve the organization and version information. The CloudFormation service requires that template
files be hosted from S3 and by publishing to the repo we make versioned artifacts available for inclusion into other
templates.

=== Data Flows

. *Publish templates via GitHub push:* Developers -> GitHub -> Travis CI -> Gradle plugin in project -> ArtifactS3 Repo
    in S3. Template projects would include a .travis.yml file that would call the publish task.
    * Example: `git commit -m"Updated template"; git push`
. *Publish templates directly:* Developers -> Gradle plugin in project -> ArtifactS3 Repo in S3
    * Example: `./gradlew publish`
. *ArtifactS3 repo process:* New artifact -> Unzipped by Lambda function -> Artifact is now available as a Maven
    dependency or a Cloudformation template hosted in S3
    * Example `./gradlew createStack` using a template that includes another published
        template as a
        http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html[Nested Stack].

== Build/Deploy

=== Prerequisite

* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 8 JDK^]: Download from Oracle or
    use a packaged version for your OS

=== Command

`./gradlew build` will create the ArtifactS3 repo CloudFormation template in `build/cloudformation/artifats3-repo.yaml`

=== Deployment

There are possibly several prerequisite steps that have to be accomplished manually before CloudFormation can automatically
deploy and then later update a stack.

. http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html[Install the AWS CLI^] and configure a
    http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html[named profile^]
. We'll go over all the options later in the docs but at a minimum a private repo can be created in the us-east-2 region
    using just a single command with a few parameters. The build.gradle file has a list of default options that can be
    overridden. An example of the region could have be overridden with an additional argument of -Pregion=us-west-1
[source,bash]
./gradlew updateStack -Pprofile=YOUR_PROFILE_NAME -Pstack=STACK_NAME -PDomainName=UNIQUE_S3_BUCKET_NAME
. Once the stack has finished deploying note the name of the bucket that was created as that will be referenced
    in future publishing commands as your repo. By default the bucket is private and likely you are the only person
    who can access the published materials. CloudFormation runs with the permission of the user executing the commands
    so if others need access to the published artifacts use standard S3 permissions to authorize users, groups or
    instance roles.

The default deployment creates the all of the needed components for an artifact repo. The additional parameters offer
the ability to deploy a website fronted by CloudFormation but requires a number of additional steps to create an SSL
certificate and CloudFront user prior to deployment.

=== Updates

. Updates to the stack are accomplished by running the `./gradlew updateStack` commmand again and changing either a command
    line parameter or one of the config files.

=== Configuration

Command line arguments can always be used and will override other settings but if the same parameters are used for the
majority of deployments they can be specified in a file named local-config.groovy. If present in the root directory of
the settings will get picked up and only if you want to override them do you need to use param arguments on the command
line. The file is listed in .gitignore so you won't accidentally commit it and push it to a public repo.

[source,groovy]
project.params.with {
    profile = 'my-aws-cli-profile-name'
    stack = 'artifacts3-repo-test'
    DomainName = 'repo-test-38e894739r879'
}
